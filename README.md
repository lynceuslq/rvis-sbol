# rvis-sbol
An R package to plot genomic features and bio-systems following SOBL3 standards

The R package is developed for ploting genetic elements (including CDS, promoters, terminintaors, ribozyme binding sites and polymers) and genetic regulations networks (e.g. repression and avtication) along side their positions in the genome.All objects in the package are designed to allow high flexibility with genomic plots. When intergrated as a ggplot layer, the elements can be aligned to coverage depth and other quantitative features demonstrated in the figures as their annotations.
